Genetic diseases can be classified according to their modes of inheritance and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Autosomal dominant disorders often result from DNA variants that cause loss-of-function, gain-of-function, or dominant-negative effects, while autosomal recessive diseases are primarily linked to loss-of-function variants. In this study, we introduce a graph-of-graphs approach that leverages protein-protein interaction networks and high-resolution protein structures to predict the mode of inheritance of diseases caused by variants in autosomal genes, and to classify dominant-associated proteins based on their functional effect. Our approach integrates graph neural networks, structural interactomics and topological network features to provide proteome-wide predictions, thus offering a scalable method for understanding genetic disease mechanisms.
